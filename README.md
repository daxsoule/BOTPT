Reproducibility: For every result, keep track of how it was produced Avoid manual data-manipulation steps Archive the exact versions of all external programs used Version-control all custom scripts Record all intermediate results, when possible in standard formats For analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds Always store raw data behind plots Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected Connect textual statements to underlying results Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results These recommendations suggest a certain structure for a project.

Project Layout A reproducible single-paper project directory structure might look something like this
