    "### Abstract\n",
    "The Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array (OOI-CA) provides the opportunity to use new approaches to observe geological  processes at Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano on the Juan de Fuca spreading ridge located ~300 miles off the coast of Oregon. The OOI-CA provides a suite of interdisciplinary real-time datasets from seismic and geodetic networks and a variety of instruments in two hydrothermal fields with which we can examine system-level processes governing the volcano-marine environment. The geophysical networks comprise 4 Pressure/Tilt (BOTPT) instruments that detect the rise, fall, and tilt of the seafloor as it responds to the movement of magma within the crust and 7 seismometers to monitor earthquakes. In order to better understand the patterns of magma storage and delivery beneath the Axial summit caldera and provide constraints for the development of improved predictive models, we are examining short-term variations in the rates of deformation and seismicity and how well they co-vary during the inter-eruption time period. We will also investigate apparent “pauses” in the magma supply rate when the rate of seismicity and deformation have both dropped. On the time-scale of years, seafloor deformation measurements show a relatively steady rate of inflation of the seafloor between eruptions that can be interpreted as reflecting the rate that magma is supplied to the sub-caldera magma reservoir (Nooner and Chadwick 2016). However, on the time-scale of weeks to months, the rate is more variable. Similarly, the rate of earthquakes detected by the OOI seismometer network also varies with time. It was very low immediately after the 2015 eruption, but it has increased markedly over the past year, and based on the observations of prior eruptive cycles, it is expected to increase by several orders of magnitude before the next eruption."

    "### Introduction \n",
    "   Axial Seamount rises about ~1 km above the ocean floor and has two major rift zones that extend to the north and south. Its summit is characterized by an 8-km-long caldera and three high-temperature hydrothermal vents (Arnulf, 2014; Wilcock et al, 2018). A magma body sits 1-2 km depth below the summit, stretching beyond the northern and southern extents of the caldera (West et al., 2001; Arnulf et al., 2014, Wilcock et al, 2018). Three eruptions have been observed at Axial Seamount, in 1998, 2011, and 2015, all occuring at a predictable level of inflation. In the 1998 eruption, lava flows occurred on the south rift and total deflation at the summit was ~3.2 m. Total deflation was lower in the 2011 eruption because volume of lava erupted was lower than that of the 1998 eruption. The time interval between the 2011 and 2015 eruptions is shorter than the lapsed time between the 1998 and 2011 eruptions due to increased magma supply, as the 2015 eruption displays the highest rate of inflation (60 cm/year) compared to prior eruptions Nooner and Chadwick, 2016).\n",
    "   Crustal deformation generated by volcanism is commonly attributed to inflation of a magma reservoir at depth either by influx of new melt or by volatile exsolution. For this reason, deformation can be used to assess the eruptibility of an active volcano and inform eruption forecasts. On land, surface deformation is commonly measured directly using GPS or InSAR. At Axial Seamount, surface deformation is calculated from measurements of ocean bottom pressure.  \n",
    "    The first pressure measurements at Axial Seamount began in 1987 and were calculated using autonomous bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), which were deployed and recovered every ~2 years. BPRs are still in use at Axial Seamount, though in 2014, additional instruments cabled real-time to the Ocean Observatories Initiative's Cabled Array (OOI-CA) were deployed on the volcano. The National Science Foundation’s OOI-CA is a network of over 800 instruments that measures the physical, chemical, and biological variables in the ocean and on the seafloor. These new instruments referred to as Bottom Pressure and Tilt instruments (BOTPT) are different from the autonomous BPRs in that they are capable of measuring tilt as well as vertical deformation. They also transmit their data to land in near-real time, eliminating the 2-year waiting period required by the autonomous BPRs. In 2015, the Cabled Array captured an eruption of the volcano in real time, and for this reason, and over its lifetime, the OOI Cabled Array will likely record more eruptions. \n",
    "    Seismicity is another useful tool for understanding the dynamics of a volcano. These data are used for imaging magma reservoirs as in Arnulf et al. 2018, for tracking melt migration, dike propagation, and ultimately are critical data to assess the likelihood of a volcanic eruption. There are many styles of earthquakes occurring in volcanically active regions and they provide a wealth of information about the physical processes occuring within and surrounding a reservoir. Commonly, these earthquakes are attributed to crustal rock breaking as magmatic dikes migrate away from the reservoir and toward the surface. For our study, we seek to quantify and model the relationship between seismicity induced by the the breaking of crustal rock and inflation rate. \n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "We utilized two methods to examine the rates of inflation and seismicity at the Axial. The first method involved downsampling the bottom pressure data to 15 seconds and subtracting the tidal data from it to remove tidal variations. Daily average was then obtained and compared to seismic measurements at the same interval. In the second method, inflation rate was calculated by subtracting the difference between detided depth from the Bottom Pressure Measurements (BPR) with the highest inflation rate and the site with the lowest inflation rate. The later method, even though it does not represent the actual inflation values, gives a better representation of the volcanic inflation signal because it removes tidal residuals and most oceanographic effects that are common to both stations, which are only a few kilometers apart. \n",

    "### Results\n",
    "Short-term (days to weeks) variability between deformation and seismicity shows a direct relationship.\n",
    "The relation between deformation and seismicity rates changes over time during the intereruption period. Following the 2015 eruption, a given inflation rate is associated with minor seismicity. However, further in the inter-eruption cycle, the same inflation rate is now accompanied by a higher rate of seismicity."
