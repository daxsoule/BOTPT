    "#### What is a mid-ocean ridge? Please describe the interactions and linkages among the geologic, hydrologic and biologic systems of which they are comprised. Fundamental to this effort is understanding the process of mass and energy flow from the mantle to the crust, which drives hydrothermal circulation, and creates new seafloor and supports life there. How does crustal accretion vary temporally? \n",

    "MORs are classified into fast or slow spreading rates based on the thermal regime balance between magmatic heat injection during crustal accretion and hydrothermal heat removal. This is consistent with a thermally controlled magma \"solidus\" temperature which limits the height at which magma rises to and can exist as a steady state feature at a spreading center. The stretching of strong axial lithosphere is responsible for the origin of a median valley topography (at a slow spreading ridge). "
